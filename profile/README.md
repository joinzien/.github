Zien is a WhatsApp channel to collect contemporary art as Expanded NFTs: digital art with material presence. 

Era-defining artworks are collected as 1/1 NFTs and redeemed on-chain for unique material counterparts. This new dual-state medium reflects our multidimensional lives. Through a curated WhatsApp channel, Zien offers audiences an experience of art thatâ€™s direct and personal. Each season consists of three solo drops. Each Expanded NFT redefines aura in the 21st century.
